    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Make our breaded chicken Milanese - the cheese is optional, but it takes the coating to the next level. You can also make it with turkey, pork or aubergine</p>

    <!-- ingredients list -->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Eggs :</strong> Keep the chicken moist and give the breading something to adhere to. </li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> The breading is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Bread crumbs:</strong> Use store-bought or find recipe creator Sherbear1's homemade bread crumb recipe below.</li>
        <li><strong>Chicken: </strong>Two thinly sliced, skinless, boneless chicken breast halves will make four servings. </li>
        <li><strong>Oil: </strong>Use vegetable oil for frying the chicken Milanese.</li>
        <li><strong>Lemon :</strong> Serve the chicken Milanese with lemon wedges for a bright pop of color and flavor. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Make Chicken Milanese</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>"You can buy chicken cutlets, but I find it's easier (and a bit of a better value) to buy boneless skinless chicken breasts and cut them in half yourself," <cite> -Nicole. </li>
        <li>To ensure even cooking, pound the cutlets with a meat mallet before you add the breading. This will also give you a larger surface, which means it will get extra crispy.</li>
        <li>Make sure to have a wire rack handy for draining so the bottoms do not get soggy while you work on the other cutlets.</li>
    </ol>
